            This is my second year at Syracuse University as a Magazine major. I am most excited to learn HTML and CSS because I am interested in becoming a front-end web developer. My other courses include Reporting, Tai Chi, and Global Encounters.

            I am currently a Digital Marketing Specialist for Japan Society of Northern California, a non-profit based in San Francisco. I also write feature stories for The Daily Orange, the student-run newspaper at SU. My interests include reading, writing, biking, and traveling.
